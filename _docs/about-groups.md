For example, you might create a group for your imprint or company, so that all your projects would be created within the group umbrella. This would enable you to share design templates between all the projects in your imprint, bill them all to the same credit card (attached to the group owner&#8217;s account), share fonts between all the projects or users in your group, and more. To create a group, email us at <a href="mailto:info@hederis.com" data-hederis-type="hspana" id="peX0XK9DV"><span class="Hyperlink" data-hederis-type="hspnspan" id="ptBXP8Qhd">info@hederis.com</span></a>. </p></section></body></html>
