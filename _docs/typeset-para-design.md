You can also add borders to your paragraphs, and add extra space above and below. </p><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pyajFgdeU">If you turn on the &#8220;Float to bottom?&#8221; checkbox, that type of paragraph will get positioned at the bottom of the current page. This is great for titlepages, for example if you want to position the publisher name at the bottom of the page.</p></section></body></html>
