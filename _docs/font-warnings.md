But not every font includes a glyph for every possible character that exists&#8212;this would create huge font files and would be quite a bit of work for the creator of the font. </p><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="peIVUPEO0">When Hederis renders your text, the first place the app looks for glyphs is in the font files that you&#8217;ve chosen to use. If a certain glyph can&#8217;t be found in your chosen font, then the app will look in a fallback font&#8212;a font that has a lot of glyphs and exists as a second line of defense for situations like this.</p><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pKJnkLl9O">In some cases, the fallback font may be just fine. However, the odds are that the fallback font will look quite different from your chosen fonts, and text that is rendered in that font won&#8217;t match the rest of the text in the book. You should check out each font warning, and make sure that the text looks okay in the PDF.</p><section class="hwprsubsection" data-hederis-type="hwprsubsection" id="poxEE2O0d" data-type="subsection" title="Why can I see the character in the app, but not in the PDF?"><h1 data-hederis-type="hblktitle" class="hblktitle" id="pcdVjMuxm">Why can I see the character in the app, but not in the PDF?</h1><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="phS8PD2De">Web browsers like Chrome have their own fallback fonts built in, just like Hederis. When you&#8217;re previewing the text in your browser, there&#8217;s a chance that when none of the Hederis fallback fonts contain the glyph you&#8217;re using in your text, the browser will start using its own fallback fonts, so that you can see your text. But the PDF is built outside of the web browser, so it doesn&#8217;t have access to all the fallback fonts that Chrome uses.</p></section><section class="hwprsubsection" data-hederis-type="hwprsubsection" id="pH9G4TBwk" data-type="subsection" title="What about the EPUB?"><h1 data-hederis-type="hblktitle" class="hblktitle" id="pWsQhkZzM">What about the EPUB?</h1><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p594p4ux8">Hederis embeds a small collection of fallback fonts in the EPUB files, to try to help catch as many glyphs as possible. However, it&#8217;s up to the creators of each eReading device (like the Nook, Kindle, etc.) to make sure that they come with a font that can handle a wide variety of glyphs.</p></section><section class="hwprsubsection" data-hederis-type="hwprsubsection" id="pDKKbwsLZ" data-type="subsection" title="How can I fix a font warning?"><h1 data-hederis-type="hblktitle" class="hblktitle" id="pQEWdcH6G">How can I fix a font warning?</h1><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pM6V6BLQ1">There are a few ways you can resolve missing glyph issues, but here are a couple of suggestions:</p><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p2WtUeyQR"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong" id="pWeLtpGrZ">Choose a font that contains all the glyphs you need.</strong></p><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pDnBMHllI">This is the most obvious solution, but also easier said than done. Many font web stores allow you to type custom text to test a font, and you can try typing the special characters you want to make sure the font supports. You can also use a tool like Font Forge to look at the glyphs contained in a font. If you find a good option, upload it in the Fonts section of the Design tools, and then apply it to your paragraphs as desired.</p><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pWXJwKmnm"><strong class="hspanstrong" data-hederis-type="hspanstrong" id="pPDr4yUsO">Intentionally apply your own font to words/paragraphs with missing glyphs.</strong></p><ol class="hwprnumlist" data-hederis-type="hwprnumlist" id="pyQXIZVmQ"><li class="hblkoli" data-hederis-type="hblkoli" id="liBlSx2Usl"><p class="hblkoli" data-hederis-type="hblklip" id="pq3xA5XpL">For just a few words: If the words aren&#8217;t already wrapped in an inline, then follow the instructions in &#8220;<a href="{% link _docs/add-an-inline.md %}" class="hspana" data-hederis-type="hspana" id="pSm1gnqD5">Add or Delete an Inline</a>&#8221; to the word(s) you want to apply the custom font to, and apply the &#8220;Key phrase&#8221; inline style. Then go to the Design preview, click the words where you applied the new inline, and click to select it.</p></li><li class="hblkoli" data-hederis-type="hblkoli" id="li3zEFJjuN"><p class="hblkoli" data-hederis-type="hblklip" id="pqnGSh64n">For a whole paragraph: In the Design preview, click to select the paragraph.</p></li><li class="hblkoli" data-hederis-type="hblkoli" id="liSCP3cY2w"><p class="hblkoli" data-hederis-type="hblklip" id="pQzpjfk8r">In the &#8220;Limit these changes&#8221; menu, choose &#8220;Only this [type of element selected]&#8221;.
