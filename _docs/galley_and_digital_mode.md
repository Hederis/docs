Since Galley &amp; Digital mode is intended to be used for people who are creating either galleys (print ARCs or bound galleys, or digital galleys for outlets like NetGalley), or straight-to-ebook projects, we&#8217;ve removed the &#8220;Page Layout&#8221; tools that show up in the Design pane. If you need finer control over your page and line breaks, we recommend that you upgrade your project to full Typeset mode.</p><p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pmBrnBKjq">Additionally, when creating PDFs in Galley &amp; Digital mode, you&#8217;re required to include a watermark on your files. This can be either a text watermark in the running header or footer (or both), or an image watermark behind the text of each page, or both. If you don&#8217;t configure any watermark for your galley PDFs, a text watermark will automatically be inserted in the running header, using some default text. You can read more about how to configure a watermark in the section &#8220;<a href="{% link _docs/add-watermark.md %}" class="hspana" data-hederis-type="hspana" id="pRjBo5C6E">Add a Watermark</a>.&#8221;</p></section></body></html>
