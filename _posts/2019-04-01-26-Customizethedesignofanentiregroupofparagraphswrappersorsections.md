    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pxTW5fCcW">You can also use processing instructions to customize the design of an entire style. For example, you can customize the design of every paragraph in your book that uses the &#8220;HED Box type&#8221; style. Similarly, you can customize the design of wrappers and sections in your book (for example, every letter in the book, or every appendix section). Follow the instructions in the previous section, but instead of using the STYLE processing instruction keyword, use GLOBAL STYLE, like this:</p>
    <img data-hederis-type="hblkimg" class="hblkimg" id="p2j2XTlv4" src="/images/globalstyle.png"/>
