    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p6Ez55YSG">We recommend that you run the epubcheck validation tool on your files before distribution, to ensure that there are no errors. We&#8217;ll be integrating epubcheck into our toolchain very soon, but we don&#8217;t want anything to slip by you in the meantime! If there are any validation errors, let us know and we can help you troubleshoot solutions: help@hederis.com</p>
