    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pbDhaYEfs">There are three categories of tags that we use in your Word manuscript: paragraphs, wrappers, and sections. <strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Paragraphs</strong> are the types of content that you&#8217;re probably most familiar with: chapter titles, plain text paragraphs, quote paragraphs, list items, and so on all fall into this category.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="p63yk35cD"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Wrappers</strong> are a way to group certain paragraphs together that should be set aside from the main flow of text in some way. For example, if you have multiple paragraphs in an extract, those would be wrapped accordingly. Some other examples are poems, letters, epigraphs, and lists. See &#8220;<a href="{% post_url 2019-07-09-16-AddaWrapper %}"><span class="Hyperlink">Add a Wrapper</span></a>&#8221; for more on this.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="pNcFXlUnJ">In your Word manuscript, wrappers look like this:</p>
    <img data-hederis-type="hblkimg" class="hblkimg" id="puRdAslUS" src="/images/wrapper1.png"/>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="ps1lcsVVW">Many people are accustomed to using paragraph styles for everything, which results in very large style sets. For example, you&#8217;d need separate styles for body text vs. a text paragraph inside an extract, or for an extract title vs. a sidebar title. By using wrappers, we make it much easier to manage the number of paragraph styles you need to use. You can use the <em data-hederis-type="hspanem">HED Plain text paragraph</em> style for both your main body text and for the text inside your extracts, and because your extracts are enclosed in a wrapper, you&#8217;ll still be able to design those paragraphs differently if you want to.</p>
    <p class="hblkp" data-hederis-type="hblkp" id="piNaqnMEM"><strong data-hederis-type="hspanstrong">Sections</strong> are the main chunks of your manuscript - you probably use words like chapters, parts, appendixes, prefaces, etc., to describe the sections in your book. At Hederis, we have special styles to mark your section breaks (see &#8220;<a href="{% post_url 2019-07-09-17-AddaSection %}"><span class="Hyperlink">Add a Section</span></a>&#8221; to learn more). These section break styles tell our app where and how to split up your manuscript, and these breaks are used to create book features like your ebook table of contents (you can have more granular control over that if you want to &#8211; check out &#8220;<a href="{% post_url 2019-07-09-18-AutomaticallyGenerateaTableofContents %}"><span class="Hyperlink">Automatically Generate a Table of Contents</span></a>&#8221; for more). In Word, section breaks look like this:</p>
